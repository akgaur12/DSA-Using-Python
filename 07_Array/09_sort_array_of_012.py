Problem: Sort 0s, 1s and 2s  
GFG Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/sort-an-array-of-0s-1s-and-2s4231/1

Description:
Given an array consisting of only 0s, 1s, and 2s, sort the array in-place without using any sorting algorithm.

This is a variation of the Dutch National Flag problem.

Approach:
1. Count the number of 0s, 1s, and 2s in the array.
2. Overwrite the original array by placing all 0s first, followed by 1s, and then 2s.

Time Complexity: O(n)  
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” No extra space used apart from a few integer variables.
