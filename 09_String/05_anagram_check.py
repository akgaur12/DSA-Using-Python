Problem: Check if two strings are anagrams of each other.

Definition:
-----------
Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters 
in the same frequency but possibly in different order.

Approach:
---------
1. First, check if the lengths of the strings are different.
   - If yes, they can't be anagrams.
2. Use a hash map (dictionary) to count the frequency of each character in the first string.
3. Traverse the second string:
   - For each character, decrement its count in the hash map.
   - If a character in str2 doesnâ€™t exist in the hash map, return False.
4. After processing both strings, verify that all frequency values are zero.

Time Complexity: O(n)
- n = length of the strings (since they are equal length).
- One pass through each string and a final pass through the map.

Space Complexity: O(1)
- At most 26 characters (if only lowercase English), so constant space.

Args:
-----
str1 (str): First string
str2 (str): Second string

Returns:
--------
bool: True if the strings are anagrams, False otherwise.
