Problem: Merge Two Sorted Arrays Without Extra Space
GFG Link: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/merge-two-sorted-arrays-1587115620/1

Description:
-------------
Given two sorted arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, merge them so that the final result is also sorted.
Do not use extra space (i.e., modify the arrays in-place).

Approach: Gap Method (Shell Sort Style)
----------------------------------------
1. Use a gap (initially (n + m) / 2) to compare elements that are far apart.
2. Gradually reduce the gap and perform comparisons/swaps:
   - Compare elements within `arr1`.
   - Compare elements across `arr1` and `arr2`.
   - Compare elements within `arr2`.
3. Stop when the gap reduces to 0.

This approach avoids using extra space and still manages to rearrange both arrays in sorted order.

Time Complexity: O((n + m) log(n + m)) â€” due to repeated gap passes
Space Complexity: O(1) â€” in-place

Example:
---------
Input: 
  arr1 = [1, 4, 7, 8, 10]
  arr2 = [2, 3, 9]

Output: 
  arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 7]
  arr2 = [8, 9, 10]
