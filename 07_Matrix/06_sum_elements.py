Problem: Sum of Matrix Elements

Description:
-------------
This function calculates the **sum of all elements** in a 2D matrix (list of lists).

Approach:
---------
1. Traverse each row of the matrix.
2. For each row, iterate through all elements and keep adding to a running total.
3. Return the final sum.

Time Complexity: O(n Ã— m), where n is the number of rows and m is the number of columns.
Space Complexity: O(1), since we use only a constant amount of space.
