"""
Program to generate the **Fibonacci series** up to `n` terms (starting from 0 and 1).

The **Fibonacci series** is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.
The series starts as: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

This program:
- Accepts multiple test cases.
- Prints the series with (n + 2) terms (starts from 0 and 1, and includes n additional terms).
- Handles invalid and negative input.

Examples:
    Input: n = 3
    Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Time Complexity:
---------------
- O(n) â€” iterates n times to generate the sequence
