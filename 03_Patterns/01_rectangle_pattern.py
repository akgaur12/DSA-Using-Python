Pattern Printing: Solid and Hollow Rectangle

Description:
------------
This module provides two functions:
1. `solid_rectangle(r, c)`: Prints a solid rectangle made of asterisks (*) with `r` rows and `c` columns.
2. `hollow_rectangle(r, c)`: Prints a hollow rectangle where only the border is made of asterisks, and the inside is empty.

Each function directly prints the desired pattern to the console.

Examples:
---------
>>> solid_rectangle(3, 5)
* * * * * 
* * * * * 
* * * * * 

>>> hollow_rectangle(4, 5)
* * * * * 
*       * 
*       * 
* * * * * 

Time Complexity: O(r Ã— c)
    - Both functions iterate over each of the `r` rows and `c` columns to build the pattern.

Space Complexity: O(1)
    - Only loop variables and control structures are used. No extra space required.

Note: Each asterisk is followed by a space for better visual clarity in pattern alignment.
